# High-Capacity-Image-Steganography
## Implementation of High-Capacity Image Steganography Based on Improved FC-DenseNet (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9197597) on CIFAR100 and LFW datasets using Pytorch

In this work, I have used CIFAR100 and LFW datasets to train a fully convolutional neural network for implementing image steganography, a technique for hiding an image into another image without any change in the carrier image.
